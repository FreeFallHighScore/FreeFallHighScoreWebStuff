				<p class="contenttxt overview">
					Freefall Highscore wants you to design amazing and stylish 
					ways of protecting falling phones while play our game. We 
					call them 'preservers'. Anything you can come up with to stop 
					a falling device from smashing to bits upon impact. It could be a 
					hamster ball and rubber bands, it could be crab-cage with motion 
					sensing airbags. It could be team of outfielders standing below with incredibly soft gloves.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<strong>THINK OF IT AS YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL EGG-DROP WITH GREATER RISK AND GREATER REWARD</strong>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p class="contenttxt">
					To encourage creativity at the premiere of the Freefall game we're asking you to submit your preservers. 
					Send us documentation of your *finished* preservers and we'll choose *seven of them* to compete in an 
					epic drop during the The Creators Project event in Dumbo, New York this October.
				</p>
				
				<a name="prizes"><h2>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</h2></a>
				<br clear="all">
				<p class="contenttxt">
					The winning preservers will each be given an iPod Touch Video to fit into their preserver. If the device survives the fall, you get to keep it! (well, you'll get to keep it even if it doesn't survive...)
					<br/><br>
					In addition all of the players in the drop will be given VIP tickets to the The Creators Project event in NYC.
					<br/><br>
					On top of that your inventive preserver will be prominently featured in the Freefall Highscore gallery exhibition in DUMBO.
					<br/>

				<a name="judging"><h2>JUDGING CRITERIA</h2></a>
				<br clear="all">
				<p class="contenttxt">We're looking for fun over function. Sure you should protect the device, but here's some things to think about that will get you extra style points</p>
				<p class="contenttxt">
					<ul>
						<li>Will it work? First and fore-most you have to convince us that your preserver strategy will stand a chance of saving your *precious* device.</li>
						<li>It's video art! So we encourage modding the camera on the phone to make the Freefall Video more interesting and original.
						<li>We encourage highly aesthetic and over the top designs. Go overboard!
						<li>Likewise, we'd love to see amazingly minimal designs that are extremely elegant.
						<li>Design with poetic or conceptual ideas behind them. What does this falling represent to you? Can you personsonifity the device's feelings during the drop?
						<li>Performative drops involving lots of people above or below to pull it off
						<li>Anything with smarts, style, and creativity.
					</ul>
				</p>
				<a name="constraints"><h2>CONSTRAINTS</h2></a>
				<br clear="all">
				<p class="contenttxt">The sky is the limit with your designs but you have to keep the following constraints in mind:</p>
				<p class="contenttxt">
					<ul>
						<li>Freefall means *free fall*, there can be no external forces (including gravity) affecting the device or the drop won't qualify. This means no spinning, launching, or aggressively tethering the device.</li>
						<li>Your preserver cannot obstruct the camera from recording video. Augmenting it in some way is encouraged, but you can't black the video out by putting the device in a big padded box.</li>
						<li>Timelimit.  You have 20 seconds between when you hit "drop" on the app to rig it and drop it before the drop timer times out.  Your preserver has got to be quick loading.</li>
						<li>One Shot Drop.  You can test your devices at home if you find a way, but you get on chance to drop your preserver during the event so your system has got to be reliable!</li>
						<li>Fall location. Each contestent is going to be dropping from the same undiscloved location. Your preserver system has got to be portable and flexible to adapt to guerrilla-style drops.</li>
						<li>Fall height. We're really gonna drop these suckers from way way up, so be prepared for fall heights upwards of 140 feet.</li>
					</ul>
